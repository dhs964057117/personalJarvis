### Fixed

* Fix JSON data parsing process to improve performance.
* Fix a problem where `setClippingMaskBufferSize` in `CubismRendererAndroid` would be thrown a `NullPointerException` if there are no clipping masks in the model.

### Removed

* Remove dependencies not to be used.
* Remove the unused method `getMotionMap` in `ICubismModelSetting` and `CubismModelSettingJson` class.

### Added

* Add support for high-precision masks.
* Implement to throw an exception when a user attempt to give null value to a setter method.

* Change the specification of the logging functions in `CubismDebug` so that they can take a format string as an argument.

### Fixed

* Change `radianToDirection` function in `CubismMath` so that an instance of CubismVector2 created by an API user is given as second argument, and the calculation result is stored in that instance and returned.
* Change the type of cache variables for vertex information used in `doDrawModel` function in `CubismRendererAndroid` and `setupClippingContext` function in `CubismClippingManagerAndroid` from `Map` to array.
  * The cost of converting `int` type to `Integer` type (auto-boxing) that was incurred every frame was removed by this change.
